Description:
Our final project is a modeled domain of a community centre. We made a website using php and html in order to display info stored in our database. The database model was constructed from a previous milestone, and slightly improved upon as we implemented the website to contain data tables and working sql queries that the user could request. Along with displaying this information to the user, a simple GUI was made to allow the user to easily navigate the different categories (entities), and make query requests with ease. 

Our community website will keep track of all the members, Employees, parking stalls, rooms, foods, events and other community centers. This includes an Employee’s data such as salary, hours, age such that a manager could easily figure out how much salary he owns or find out who the oldest Employee is. Members can also use their members page to figure out what their assigned parking stall number is, and then find that number on the parking stall page to figure out what type of stall it is, and how long they can park for. Users can also use the events page to look up all the different events, and staff members can add/modify/delete events accordingly. Lastly users can use our foods page to find out all the vendors we have and their locations, and food vendor owners can use our food logs function to figure out what food is most popular.

Navigating Our Project:
Our before/after screenshots of our working functionality is in the ‘~/snapshots/’ directory, they are organized accordingly.

Our SQL scripts (using MySQL) are in the ‘~/sql_scripts/’ directory. A full script to build the entire database is ‘create_insert.sql’.

All our SQL queries are in the main project folder in a file called ‘sql_list.txt’.
