Changes we made so far:

- Took the feedback from milestone 2, create a super class table Employee so that our eats and parks membership is more efficient
- Change table names (eg. Volunteer_WorksIn to just Volunteer)
- Remove guardian name attribute for Volunteer
- Remove location attribute for Volunteer, Contractor, Staff
- Add/Modify attributes (eg. contract_time to contract_start and contract_end in Contractor table)
- add new attribute Food, timeAte to EmployeeEats and MemberEats relation
- add NOT NULL constraint to some attributes
