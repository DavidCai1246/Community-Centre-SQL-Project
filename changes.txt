Changes we made so far:

- Took the feedback from milestone 2, create a super class table Employee so that our eats and parks membership is more efficient
- Change table names (eg. Volunteer_WorksIn to just Volunteer)
- Remove guardian name attribute for Volunteer
- Remove location attribute for Volunteer, Contractor, Staff
- Add/Modify attributes (eg. contract_time to contract_start and contract_end in Contractor table)
- add new attribute Food, timeAte to EmployeeEats and MemberEats relation
- add new attribute role to staff role
- add NOT NULL constraint to some attributes
- Remove location from primary key of Community_Centre, getting errors when declaring foreign keys
- change the char length for some attributes
- Removed the Parks relationship from ERD as assigning a parking number is equivalent
- Add attributes name, age, address to member
- Add type attribute to employee table so that we can do Nested aggregation with group-by query easier
